// This is an implementation of the Effective Index Method for 2D waveguide cross sections
// It is valid for certain waveguide cross section geometries and is accurate to around 3 decimal places
// The method is based on the three and four layer slab waveguide solvers
// As a comparison consider the online solver http://www.computational-photonics.eu/eims.html
